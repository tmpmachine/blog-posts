# Planning The Android App - ROP Time Management System Devlog #1

I had a call with PacoLemon team on Saturday morning to give a brief about the Ratio of Priority (ROP) time management system development plan.

After taking feedback, using ROP tool prototype, I set 20% priority ratio for Android app development right away, promising that the team could expect progress on it by next week.

If it were before ROP was formulated, that promise would mean only to hype the mood, but not today!

## Prototype Right Away

I dislikes Android development, mainly because the development felt sluggish.

Thanks to ROP's high rate of to enter [the State of Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), I build a working prototype later that night.

I also adjusted the priority ratio of Android development to 70%.

I dislikes Android development, still, but a surge of motivation sure help, and that's ROP for you!
